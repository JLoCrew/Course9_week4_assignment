Shiny App to predict temperature in New York

This marks the last assignment for Course 9: Developing Data Product.  Using the "airquality" R dataset, I created a Shiny app that allows users predict temperature in New York City by adjusting independent variables such as Ozone leve, Solar.R exposure, wind speed and month.

The Shiny app is here: https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/307148
